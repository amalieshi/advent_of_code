 solving Advent of Code 2022
 
 **The Advent of Code** is my favourite Christmas activity! I love the advent calendar, and I finally find a place to do something that I love and have Christmas themed word problems and I could solve them and publish it on GitHub. Solving these types of puzzles are really fun. I am using a little bit of hack from Notepad++ with the replacement function though. The input that I got were put into list by using the replaced and multiline edit functions. The first part is usually the input but if you scroll low enough(ctrl+End) you can see my solution. I am still new in the whole refactoring shenanigan so bear with me! I promise I will get better.
